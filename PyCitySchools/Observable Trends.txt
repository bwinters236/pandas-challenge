1.  Charter schools are doing much better with 90 percent of students passing both math and reading.  Public schools have an abysmal overall 
passing rating, with almost 50 percent of students failing math or reading.  

2.  Spending per student does not have as marked an effect as one would think.  Public's schools massive budgets give them the highest budget 
per student, but the larger the budget per student is shown to have a negative effect on scores.  The problems in the public schools cannot 
be solved by merely increasing the budget for those schools.
